2 different multipliers:

Sequential multiplier uses a finite state machine to compute the product of two 4-bit numbers. It is more efficient space-wise.

Combinational multiplier uses dataflow modeling and combinational logic to compute the product of two 4-bit numbers. It is more efficient time-wise.

Testbenches check both modules using several different pairs of inputs.
